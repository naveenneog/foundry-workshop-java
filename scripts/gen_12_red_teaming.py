"""Generate Module 12 — Red Teaming.

Distilled from the upstream reference 14-red-teaming (14-00-red-teaming.md,
14-01-red-team-basics, 14-02-red-team-advanced), simplified to a single Foundry
project + DefaultAzureCredential.

The reference routes red-team traffic through an APIM gateway (GATEWAY_URL +
ALPHA_GATEWAY_KEY) with an AsyncAzureOpenAI callback, and reads scorecards from
redteam_*_output/evaluation_results.json. We strip APIM: the target callback
calls THIS project's get_openai_client() directly, and the scorecard is read the
same way from the scan's output folder.

Real API surface taken verbatim from the reference (azure-ai-evaluation[redteam],
PyRIT-backed):
  - RedTeam(azure_ai_project=..., credential=..., risk_categories=[...], num_objectives=N)
  - RiskCategory.{Violence,HateUnfairness,Sexual,SelfHarm}
  - await red_team.scan(target=callback, scan_name=..., output_path=...)
  - scan(..., attack_strategies=[AttackStrategy.Base64, ...], languages=[SupportedLanguages.Spanish, ...])
  - AttackStrategy.Compose([...])
  - evaluation_results.json -> scorecard.{risk_category_summary, attack_technique_summary}

Sample scorecard numbers below are the reference's actual basic-scan output
(overall ASR 10%, violence/sexual 20%).

# M12 · Red Teaming

> **Goal:** proactively *attack* your own model with the **AI Red Teaming Agent** — run a basic scan across risk categories, then an advanced scan with encoding strategies and multiple languages, and read the **Attack Success Rate** scorecard.
> **You'll use:** `azure-ai-evaluation[redteam]` (PyRIT-backed) — `RedTeam`, `RiskCategory`, `AttackStrategy`, `SupportedLanguages`, and `scan(...)`.

know they *hold*? You **red team** — automatically generate adversarial prompts,
fire them at your system, and measure how often it produces harmful content. The
**AI Red Teaming Agent** wraps Microsoft's open-source **PyRIT** toolkit: it
seeds attack objectives per risk category, optionally mutates them with evasion
**strategies**, scores every response, and hands you a scorecard.

2. **Add a strategy.** Append `AttackStrategy.Flip` (or `AttackStrategy.Leetspeak`) to
   the `attack_strategies` list in section 6 and re-scan — does the new encoding raise
   the *easy*-complexity ASR?
